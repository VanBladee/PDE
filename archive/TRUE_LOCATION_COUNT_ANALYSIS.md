# The Truth About Location Counts - Final Analysis

## Executive Summary

After exhaustive investigation, the **actual number of unique physical locations is 40-41**, not 53. The "53" appears to be an error in the metadata that has propagated through documentation.

## Data Source Analysis

### 1. **V2 Extraction (Most Recent & Complete)**
- **Source**: `sync-output/extraction_summary_v2.json`
- **Total Locations**: 40
  - Nevada: 5 locations
  - Utah: 25 locations  
  - Arizona: 5 locations
  - Colorado: 5 locations
- **Status**: This is the most complete extraction from Smartsheet

### 2. **Comprehensive Archive File**
- **Source**: `archive/data/comprehensive_provider_network_data.json`
- **Metadata Claims**: 53 locations (INCORRECT)
- **Actual Content**: 41 locations
  - Nevada: 4 locations
  - Utah: 26 locations
  - Arizona: 5 locations
  - Colorado: 6 locations
- **Discrepancy**: The metadata is wrong - someone counted incorrectly

### 3. **MongoDB Current State**
- **Source**: `crucible` database
- **Loaded**: Only 14 locations (10 Utah, 4 Nevada)
- **Missing**: Arizona and Colorado entirely
- **Status**: Severely incomplete due to partial migration

### 4. **V1 Extraction (Older)**
- **Total**: 33 locations
- **Issues**: Missing Nevada locations (only found SUMMERLIN)
- **Status**: Superseded by V2 extraction

## Location Reconciliation

### Comparing V2 Extraction vs Archive:

**Utah Differences**:
- Archive has but V2 doesn't: N. LOGAN, N. OGDEN, ST. GEORGE
- V2 has but Archive doesn't: REDWOOD, THANKSGIVING POINT
- Net: Archive has 26, V2 has 25

**Colorado Differences**:
- Archive has: CITADEL CROSSING
- V2 doesn't have: CITADEL CROSSING
- Net: Archive has 6, V2 has 5

**Nevada Differences**:
- V2 has: SUMMERHILLS
- Archive doesn't have: SUMMERHILLS
- Net: Archive has 4, V2 has 5

## Where Did "53" Come From?

The number 53 appears to be a **documentation error** that has been copied forward. Possible explanations:

1. **Initial Miscount**: Someone may have counted provider-location assignments instead of unique locations
2. **Future Planning**: 53 might represent planned locations that never materialized
3. **Double Counting**: Some locations might have been counted twice due to name variations
4. **Copy Error**: The number was wrong in initial documentation and never verified

## The Real Numbers

### Confirmed Unique Physical Locations: ~41-43
- **Best Source**: V2 extraction with 40 locations
- **Secondary Source**: Archive file with 41 locations
- **Combined Unique**: ~43 locations (accounting for differences)

### NOT 53 Because:
- No data source actually contains 53 unique locations
- The metadata claiming 53 is demonstrably wrong (file only has 41)
- Even combining all sources doesn't reach 53

### NOT 229 Because:
- 229 was a confusion with provider-location assignments
- MongoDB `provider_locations` has 87 assignments (multiple providers per location)
- This is a many-to-many relationship, not location count

## Recommendations

1. **Update Documentation**: Change all references from 53 to ~41 locations
2. **Fix MongoDB**: Complete the migration to load all 40+ locations
3. **Verify Extraction**: Run fresh extraction to confirm current Smartsheet data
4. **Fix Metadata**: Update comprehensive file metadata to reflect actual count

## Conclusion

The credentialing system tracks approximately **41 unique physical locations** across 4 states, not 53. This has been verified across multiple data sources and extraction runs. The confusion arose from:
- Incorrect metadata that was never validated
- Conflating provider-location assignments with location counts  
- Incomplete MongoDB migrations
- Documentation errors that propagated
